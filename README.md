              Simple Interest
To calculate Simple Interest, this code accepts principal,rate and time.
To calculate for the Simple Interest, first import the module name "si_calc".
Then, type the module name "si_calc" followed by a full stop then the function "simple_interest", followed by an open bracket. (Eg:si_calc.simple_interest()).
After the above step, in the open bracket, input the value of principal(amount of money), time(duration), rate(in percentage %) repectively.
run the code to calculate fir the simple interest.

                principal
To calculate principal, this code accepts interest,rate and time.
To calculate for the principal, first import the module name "si_calc".
Then, type the module name "si_calc" followed by a full stop then the function "principal", followed by an open bracket. (Eg:si_calc.principal()).
After the above step, in the open bracket, input the value of interest(interest on loan), rate(in percentage %), time(duration),  repectively.
run the code to calculate fir the Percentage.


                 Time
To calculate time, this code accepts interest,rate and principal.
To calculate for the time, first import the module name "si_calc".
Then, type the module name "si_calc" followed by a full stop then the function "time", followed by an open bracket. (Eg:si_calc.time()).
After the above step, in the open bracket, input the value of interest(interest on loan), principal(amountof money), rate(in percentage %) repectively.
run the code to calculate for the Time.


                Rate
To calculate time, this code accepts interest,time and principal.
To calculate for the time, first import the module name "si_calc".
Then, type the module name "si_calc" followed by a full stop then the function "rate", followed by an open bracket. (Eg:si_calc.rate()).
After the above step, in the open bracket, input the value of interest(interest on loan), principal(amount of muney), time(duration) repectively.
run the code to calculate for the Rate.
